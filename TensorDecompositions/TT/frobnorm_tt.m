function tt_norm = frobnorm_tt(tt_site_n)
%frobnorm_tt(tt,n) 
%   Algorithm that computes the frobenius norm of a TT, which is in site-n mixed canonical form 
%      
%INPUT:
%   tt (cell array with N+1 cells): tensor train (tt) decomposition of a 
%                                   N-th order tensor, where the tt-cores 
%                                   are stored in the first N cells and the 
%                                   location of the norm-core is stored in the 
%                                   N+1 cell. The TT is in site-n mixed
%                                   canonical form
%OUTPUT:
%   tt_norm (double):               frobenius norm of corresponsing tensor
