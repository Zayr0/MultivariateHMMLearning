function [seq_binned,y] = bin_emissions(seq_unbinned,d)
%BIN_EMISSIONS takes a sequence of real-valued emissions and calculates a
%sequence of discrete emissions by binning the real-valued emissions.
%The bin bounds are given by quantiles.
% INPUT     seq_unbinned    Long sequence of emissions
%           d               Number of bins / emissions
% OUTPUT    seq_binned      Sequence with discrete emissions after binning
%           y               Vector of quantiles
